For example, water flossers are ideal for cleaning around braces, bridges, and other dental work that can be difficult to clean with conventional flossing. Additionally, dental professionals in the Asia–Pacific region are increasingly recommending water flossers for patients with periodontal issues, as these devices help reduce gum inflammation and prevent the recurrence of gum disease.
